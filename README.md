an application which is the logic core simulator of a simple board game.

##1 Introduction 
In this experiment, you are expected to implement an application which is the logic core simulator of a simple board game. Main focus point of this experiment is to get you familiar with polymorphism. Implementing the program without using the benefits of polymorphism will be penalized. 

##2 Problem 
There are two sides which are called Zorde and Calliance. Main theme of the game is the war between two sides. Each side has 3 different types of characters. The game is played on a board where each character occupies a cell on the board (just like chess). During the progress of the game, each side makes moves in turns. The aim of the game is to kill every opponent character.
